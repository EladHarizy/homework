	\item % 1
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item % a
		The language \(\lang = \lang_1 \cap \lang_2 \cap \dots \cap \lang_n\), where every \(\lang_i\) is a regular language, is regular, since intersection is closed under finite intersection.

		\item % b
		The language \(\lang = \lang_1 \cap \lang_2 \cap \dots\), where every \(\lang_i\) is a regular language, is not regular, since intersection is not closed under infinite intersection.

		\item % c
		If a language \(\mathcal{R}\) is regular, and for some language \(\lang\), \(\lang - \mathcal{R}\) is regular, then \(\lang\) is regular. This is because \(\lang = (\lang - \mathcal{R}) \cup \mathcal{R}\), and regular languages are closed under finite union.
